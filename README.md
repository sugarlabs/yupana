How to use the Yupana?
---------------------

- The beads are organized in columns, where the units (1s) column is farthest to the right; tens (10s) is second from the right; hundreds (100s) is third from the right, etc.
- Click on a dot and it will reverse its state (color), and either add or subtract value from that column.

Yupana is not a part of Sugar desktop, but is often added.  Please refer to:
